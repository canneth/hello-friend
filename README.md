  <h2>Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    This is primarily learning project where I take my first stabs at Vue 3 and designing for WebSockets.
    <br />
    <br />
    This project is a work-in-progress, and will probably be so for a very long time!

  <h2>Development Status</h2>
  <p>
    The web app is <strong>very incomplete</strong>, and is undergoing <strong>active development</strong>,
    meaning that what works today may break tomorrow.
    <br />
    <br />
    At the moment, <strong>only the frontend is hosted and publicly accessible.</strong>
    The backend is in a state of development that is not yet ready for hosting.
    As such, there is nothing much to interact with in the hosted frontend in the meantime.
  </p>

  <h3>Feature List and Progress</h3>

    Outstanding features are roughly listed according to priority, in descending order.
